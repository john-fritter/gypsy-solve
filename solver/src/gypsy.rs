//! Gypsy as the search sees it: the transposition key, the move ordering, and
//! the [`Game`] implementation that ties them to `gypsy_core`.
//!
//! # The transposition key
//!
//! Two positions get the same key only when they have the same future. That is
//! a narrower claim than "they look alike", and the difference is where this
//! game is unusual: the stock deal sends card *i* to column *i*, so column
//! order is part of the position for as long as cards remain undealt. See
//! `DECISIONS.md`, 2026-09-11.
//!
//! Sound unconditionally:
//!
//! - the remaining stock is folded in as its **length** alone, because nothing
//!   ever returns a card to the stock, so for one deal the length fixes the
//!   remaining sequence exactly;
//! - the two foundation slots of a suit are sorted, because they are rank
//!   counters and no rule distinguishes them.
//!
//! Sound only once the stock is empty, and gated on it here:
//!
//! - the eight columns are folded in order-insensitively.
//!
//! Keys are 128 bits and compared in full on lookup, so a false match needs a
//! genuine 128-bit collision rather than a bucket clash. At ten million states
//! in a deal that is around `1e-25`, which is the point: a false match merges
//! two different futures and can turn a winnable deal into a reported
//! `unsolvable`, and that error is invisible in the output.
